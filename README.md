#### Check ESLint

You can verify [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) rules attendance running following command:

```sh
  npm run lint
```

###### Obs: you'll probably have no response on your analyzis. It occurs whenever is found no errors on the code styling. Try to make some mess ðŸ’© on formatting and run this command again. Now you must see some errors pointed in your terminal.
